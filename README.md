<h1 align='center'>Biketrace Shop - backend | MERN mobile application</h1>
<br />

## Project information

<p align='center'>My goal with this project was to create something meanigful for the company where I did my internship. The CEO & Founder of the company Biketrace, Mauro Pereira, and I, had a mutual agreement about that it was perfectly fine that I did my Thesis Project at Biketrace. He mentioned to me that he needed a mobile application where he could sell his product and magazines. The application was created with React Native, Express, Node, and MongoDB. The idea is that I am going to build the boilerplate, create some of the advanced functionalities, and that future employees of the company and future students are going to work further with this app and finally launch it on App Store and Google Play. A user can browse throguh the products, with filter method, and also type the specific name of the product or the authors name of the product. A user can ADD, DELETE whereas an admin in the future is supposed to ADD, POST, UPDATE, and CREATE. </p>
